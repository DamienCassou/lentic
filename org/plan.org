* Enhancement

** More Modes to support

*** Emacs Lisp and Markdown

Markdow is probably enough for most of our purposes.

*** Clojure and Asciidoc

I think that this would be a nice combination of something immediately
web-capable for the tawny documentation/tutorial. The idea would be to have
each file as single namespace which would define up top. This would enable me
to drop the ontology and start again periodically as I choose.


** Optimisation

Currently, we make no use of the before change data, and clone the entire
buffer, which is clearly a long term disaster.
