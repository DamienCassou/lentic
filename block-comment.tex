\begin{document}

Here we define some text in latex

\begin{code}

;; Here is some code
(println "Hello")

;; Or we can add comments here.
(println "Although this works")

\end{code}

And now we have an end code delimiter block

\begin{code}
(println "hello world")

(defn functioncall [x y]
  (+ x y))
\end{code}

And, finally, we finish off the document

\end{document}

%% Leaving just a comment block which is commented in both languages.
%% where we define out local variables.

%%
%% Local Variables:
%% linked-buffer-secondary-file: "block-comment.tex"
%% End:
