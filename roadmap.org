* 0.9 indirect-buffer replacement

Lentic can serve as a reasoanble replacements for indirect-buffers now that it
runs efficiently. For 0.9 there will be a "make-lentic-buffer" function that
is a direct replacement for "make-indirect-buffer".

* 0.10 Improved el->org, orgel->org

Currently, the orgel->org is not very good, so I want to improve this. In
particular, I want to support :tags: because lots of people want them. The
block detection improvement needs changing to support many different source
blocks types in the same buffer. Finally, the export for orgel->org is not
ideal. At least it needs to hide "Header" (without having to use :noexport:
everytime).
